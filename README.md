# jv-immutable

There are three classes: Car, Engine and Wheel. Make class `Car` immutable.
- Implement method `changeEngine(Engine engine)`, 
that will allow you to upgrade your car, and you will be like Vin Diesel:)
- Implement method `changeColor(String newColor)`. 
- Implement method `addWheel(Wheel newWheel)`. Our car can have as many wheels as possible. Even 10 wheels)
