# jv-immutable


---
There are three classes: Car, Engine, and Wheel. Make class Car immutable.

* Implement method `changeEngine(Engine engine)`, which will allow you to upgrade your car, and you will be like Vin Diesel:)
* Implement method `changeColor(String newColor)`.
* Implement method `addWheel(Wheel newWheel)`. Our car can have as many wheels as possible. Even 10 wheels)

You also should implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods and constructor with all arguments in all classes, in order for the tests to run correctly.
